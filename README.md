# Societal Benefit Score

## Introduction

The **Societal Benefit Score** is a framework for assessing how a digital product (social network, app, platform, etc.) impacts human well-being. Rather than simply labeling features as “good” or “bad,” this system looks at both a platform’s **purpose** (Does it promote health, education, genuine connection?) and the **intensity** of specific design choices (e.g., streaks, FOMO, misinformation). By calculating a single numeric score, we can see which platforms lean more toward beneficial outcomes—and which lean more toward addictive or exploitative designs. The score value is designed to show if a product or service has a net-positive or net-negative impact on society. Zero is the baseline.

This framework is an independent, personally developed system that reflects an individual interpretation of personal and societal well-being rather than a rigorously peer-reviewed standard. While it is not derived from or formally validated by established academic research, it draws upon recognized principles in user experience, psychology, and social impact. As such, it provides a structured lens that can be valuable to researchers, designers, and practitioners interested in examining how platform features align with (or undermine) well-being.

## Examples

Here are two examples from an [article I wrote](https://ammon.substack.com/p/human-agency-in-the-age-of-ai-persuasion) on Human Agency in the Age of AI Persuasion:

1. This [chart](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9QnKJ/4/) shows dominant social/media services’ feature prominence and their societal benefit score. Anything less than zero has a negative impact on societal health. Dualingo and Strava, two popular for-profit gamified consumer apps, are also included to show how gamification and behavioral tactics can be leveraged for good, and receive a positive score.

## Core Principles

1. **Purpose matters.** The same feature—like streaks or influencer culture—can be positive in a fitness/education setting but negative in an entertainment/ad-driven setting.
2. **Feature presence has levels.** Each feature can be **Strong (S)**, **Moderate (M)**, or **Weak/None (W)**. Strong doubles the base multiplier, moderate uses the base multiplier as is, and weak/none contributes zero.
3. **Positive vs. Neutral vs. Negative features.** We categorize features into three buckets. **Positive features** always add to the score, **negative features** always subtract, and **neutral features** can switch between positive or negative (or zero) depending on the product’s mission.
## Feature Categories & Multipliers

Below is the list of features with their base multipliers:
### Positive Features

- **Societal benefit focus (3x)** 
	- Company provides a service or actively supports programs that improves societal, community or individual health (mental, social, physical, political)
- **Encourages IRL (2x)**
	- Encourages IRL or promotes genuine connection in a meaningful way.
- **Data ownership (2x)**
	- Respects use data, has a privacy/user ownership-first model, does not monetize data without asking first and/or provides options for paid service that does not use their data.
- **Opt-out controls (1x)**
	- Ability to opt out of neutral and negative attention/motivation tactics.
- **Badges / Levels (1x)**
	- Rewards positive behavior with recognition.
### Neutral Features

- **Streaks (±1)**
	- Encourages continued use and punishes missing days with a broken streak.
- **Infinite scroll (±1)**
	- Perpetual promoted and personalized content.
- **Video Shorts (±2)**
	- Promotes quick, addictive, personalized videos in an endless stream.
- **Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) (±2)**
	- Leverages feelings of jealousy, anxiety, and guilt when seeing what others are doing.
- **Social pressure (±2)**
	- Triggers social anxiety and stress if ignored.
- **Location sharing (±2)**
	- Encourages public realtime location sharing.
- **Influencer culture (±2)**
	- Promotes influencer content and provides variable reward mechanics to encourage content influencer aspiration.

> **Note**: Neutral features become **positive** if the product’s primary mission is health, education, or genuine human connection; become **negative** if it’s purely ad-driven or entertainment-focused; or become **zero** if the purpose is somewhat beneficial but also potentially stressful (e.g., LinkedIn and job search).

### Negative Features

- **AI training** (monetizing user data to train AI): ×2
	- Uses your private content to train future AI models.
- **Selling your behavior** (data brokers, advanced ad targeting): ×2
	- Promotes marketing tools that allow brands to target user behaviors.
- **Misinformation**: ×3
	- Either promotes or fails to discourage misinformation.
- **Mob mentality** (filter bubbles, polarization): ×3
	- Either promotes or allows highly polarized and mob-like mentality.

These always subtract from the final score, with **strong** presence doubling the penalty.

## Presence Levels

Each feature on a product is labeled **Strong (S)**, **Moderate (M)**, or **Weak/None (W)**:
- **Strong (S)** → multiply the feature’s base multiplier by **2**.
- **Moderate (M)** → use the base multiplier as is.
- **Weak/None (W)** → **0** (no impact).
## Step-by-Step Mechanics

1. **Classify the Product’s Purpose**
    - **Health/Education/Human Connection**: Neutral features become **positive**.
    - **Primarily Ad-/Entertainment-Driven**: Neutral features become **negative**.
    - **Mixed/Partial Benefit**: Neutral features become **0**.
2. **Identify Feature Presence**
    - For each feature, decide if the platform’s use of it is **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak/None**.
3. **Apply Multipliers**
    - For each **Positive** feature present, add the base multiplier (×2 if strong).
    - For each **Neutral** feature, convert it to +, –, or 0 based on product purpose, then apply the multiplier (and double if strong).
    - For each **Negative** feature present, subtract the base multiplier (and double if strong).
4. **Sum Up the Score**
    - A higher (or positive) score suggests more user-friendly, socially beneficial design.
    - A lower (negative) score indicates heavier reliance on manipulative or exploitative patterns.

## Example Calculations

### Example: **Duolingo**
- **Purpose**: Education → **Neutral features become positive**.

Suppose we label Duolingo’s features as follows:
- **Societal benefit focus**: Moderate (M) → base +3
- **Encourages IRL**: Strong (S) → +2 doubled = +4
- **Data ownership**: Weak (W) → 0
- **Opt-out controls**: Moderate (M) → +1
- **Badges**: Strong (S) → +1 doubled = +2
- **Levels**: Strong (S) → +1 doubled = +2

Since it’s education-focused, **Neutral** features (streaks, FOMO, etc.) become **positive**:
- **Streaks**: Strong (S), base ±1 → now +1 doubled = +2
- **FOMO**: Moderate (M), base ±2 → now +2
- **Infinite scroll**: Weak (W) → 0

Negative features (AI, selling behavior, misinformation, etc.) might be weak or moderate:
- **AI training**: Moderate (M), ×2 → –2
- **Selling behavior**: Weak (W) → 0
- **Misinformation**: None (W) → 0
- **Mob mentality**: None (W) → 0
#### Summation
- **Positive**: 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18
- **Negative**: 2 (AI training) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
- **Final Score** = 18 – 2 = **+16**

### Example: **TikTok**  
- **Purpose**: Entertainment → Neutral features become **negative**.

Suppose we label TikTok’s features as follows:
- **Societal benefit focus**: Weak (W) → **0**
- **Encourages IRL**: Weak (W) → **0**
- **Data ownership**: Weak (W) → **0**
- **Opt-out controls**: Moderate (M) → **+1**
- **Badges**: Moderate (M) → **+1**
- **Levels**: Weak (W) → **0**

Since it’s **entertainment-focused**, **Neutral** features (infinite scroll, FOMO, etc.) become **negative**:
- **Infinite scroll**: Strong (S), base ±1 → now **–1** doubled = **–2**
- **Video Shorts**: Strong (S), base ±2 → now **–2** doubled = **–4**
- **FOMO**: Strong (S), base ±2 → now **–2** doubled = **–4**
- **Social pressure**: Strong (S), base ±2 → now **–2** doubled = **–4**
- **Celebrity/Influencer culture**: Strong (S), base ±2 → now **–2** doubled = **–4**
- **Streaks**: Weak (W) → **0**
- **Location sharing**: Weak (W) → **0**

Negative features (AI training, selling behavior, misinformation, etc.) might be weak or moderate:
- **AI training**: Moderate (M), ×2 → **–2**
- **Selling your behavior**: Strong (S), base ×2 → now **–2** doubled = **–4**
- **Misinformation**: Strong (S), base ×3 → now **–3** doubled = **–6**
- **Mob mentality**: Moderate (M), base ×3 → now **–3**
#### Summation
- **Positive**: 1 (Opt-out) + 1 (Badges) = **2**
- **Negative**:
    - 2 (Infinite scroll) + 4 (Video Shorts) + 4 (FOMO) + 4 (Social pressure) + 4 (Celebrity)
    - - 2 (AI training) + 4 (Selling behavior) + 6 (Misinformation) + 3 (Mob mentality)  
            = 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 3 = **33**
- **Final Score = 2 – 33 = –31**

TikTok’s **–31** indicates heavy reliance on attention hooks (infinite scroll, video shorts, FOMO) and data monetization practices, with minimal emphasis on societal well-being or user empowerment.
